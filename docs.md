# Requirements
- v0.0.5 or higher version of **Enchanced.DB**
- Basic knowledge with JS
- Better IDE

# Things to know
I was using Quick.DB for some works but i felt so much missing in **Quick.DB** so i decided to make **Enchancement.DB**! This package is not made to compete. This is just made to help others using Quick.DB with some more features! This works same as **Quick.DB** works with less codes using **better-sqlite3** and **fs**. There are no demerits with the package excpet that package stores data in key and value where as **Quick.DB** stores in **ID** and **data** which will make mess if you are using both side by side but if you know **Enchanced.DB** you can use **importQuick()** to import datas!
